# Milestone 2 Progress Report: Core Data Models & Service Interfaces

**Objective:** This report summarizes the completed work for Milestone 2 of the Backend Go project, focusing on establishing the foundational data structures and service contracts.

**Key Accomplishments:**

1.  **Defined Core Data Models:**
    *   Established the primary data structures required for the application:
        *   `Document`: Represents uploaded files and tracks their processing status (e.g., `UPLOADED`, `PROCESSING`, `COMPLETED`).
        *   `Chunk`: Represents segments of text extracted from documents, designed to hold embeddings and visualization coordinates.
        *   `Summary`: Represents AI-generated summaries of documents, also capable of storing embeddings and coordinates.
    *   Implemented basic data validation logic within each model to ensure essential fields (like IDs, filenames, text content) are present, preventing invalid data propagation.
    *   Defined a set of standardized error types related to data validation, repository operations, vector storage, and LLM interactions for consistent error handling.

2.  **Established Service Interfaces (Ports):**
    *   Defined clear contracts (Go interfaces) for how different parts of the system will interact. This promotes a modular and testable architecture (Ports & Adapters pattern).
    *   **Repository Interfaces (`DocumentRepository`, `ChunkRepository`, `SummaryRepository`):** Specify the required operations for saving, retrieving, and updating the core data models in a persistent store (database, etc.).
    *   **`VectorStore` Interface:** Defines the necessary functions for interacting with a vector database (like Qdrant), including adding/updating points (vectors), searching, deleting, and managing collections.
    *   **`LLMService` Interface:** Outlines the contract for interacting with Large Language Models (like Gemini) to generate text embeddings and summaries.

3.  **Implemented Complete Qdrant Storage Adapter:**
    *   Created a robust `QdrantClient` that fully implements the `VectorStore` interface.
    *   Implemented all vector storage operations:
        *   `EnsureCollection`: Creates and configures Qdrant collections with specified parameters.
        *   `UpsertPoints`: Adds or updates vectors with associated metadata.
        *   `Search`: Performs similarity search with optional filtering.
        *   `DeletePoints`: Removes vectors by their IDs.
        *   `GetPoints`: Retrieves vectors and their metadata by IDs.
        *   `CountPoints`: Returns the total number of vectors in a collection.
    *   Added helper functions for creating Qdrant points from document chunks and summaries.
    *   Implemented proper resource management with connection handling and cleanup.

4.  **Comprehensive Testing:**
    *   Developed unit tests for the `QdrantClient` implementation:
        *   Client initialization and connection management.
        *   Point creation from chunks and summaries.
        *   Collection management and configuration.
    *   Added integration test structure for testing against a live Qdrant instance.
    *   Validated interface implementation through compile-time checks and runtime tests.

**Milestone Status:**

Milestone 2 is now **fully complete**. All planned components have been successfully implemented and tested:
- ✓ Core data models and validation logic
- ✓ Service interfaces (Ports) definition
- ✓ Complete vector storage implementation
- ✓ Comprehensive test coverage

**Next Steps (Moving to Milestone 3):**

With the foundational data models and vector storage operations in place, the project is ready to move forward with:
*   Implementing file processing capabilities (Milestone 3)
*   Developing concrete implementations for the Repository interfaces
*   Integrating with AI services for text processing and embedding generation

This milestone provides a robust foundation for the subsequent development phases, particularly for file processing, AI integration, and search functionality.
