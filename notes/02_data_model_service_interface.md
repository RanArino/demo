# Milestone 2 Progress Report: Core Data Models & Service Interfaces

**Objective:** This report summarizes the work completed for Milestone 2 of the Backend Go project, focusing on establishing the foundational data structures and service contracts.

**Key Accomplishments:**

1.  **Defined Core Data Models:**
    *   Established the primary data structures required for the application:
        *   `Document`: Represents uploaded files and tracks their processing status (e.g., `UPLOADED`, `PROCESSING`, `COMPLETED`).
        *   `Chunk`: Represents segments of text extracted from documents, designed to hold embeddings and visualization coordinates.
        *   `Summary`: Represents AI-generated summaries of documents, also capable of storing embeddings and coordinates.
    *   Implemented basic data validation logic within each model to ensure essential fields (like IDs, filenames, text content) are present, preventing invalid data propagation.
    *   Defined a set of standardized error types related to data validation, repository operations, vector storage, and LLM interactions for consistent error handling.

2.  **Established Service Interfaces (Ports):**
    *   Defined clear contracts (Go interfaces) for how different parts of the system will interact. This promotes a modular and testable architecture (Ports & Adapters pattern).
    *   **Repository Interfaces (`DocumentRepository`, `ChunkRepository`, `SummaryRepository`):** Specify the required operations for saving, retrieving, and updating the core data models in a persistent store (database, etc.).
    *   **`VectorStore` Interface:** Defines the necessary functions for interacting with a vector database (like Qdrant), including adding/updating points (vectors), searching, deleting, and managing collections.
    *   **`LLMService` Interface:** Outlines the contract for interacting with Large Language Models (like Gemini) to generate text embeddings and summaries.

3.  **Implemented Initial Qdrant Storage Adapter:**
    *   Created a basic client (`QdrantClient`) to manage the connection to the Qdrant vector database.
    *   Implemented the `EnsureCollection` function, which checks if a specific Qdrant collection exists and creates it if necessary, ensuring the vector database is correctly set up for storing embeddings.
    *   Added a `Close` method for proper resource cleanup (closing the gRPC connection).

4.  **Added Basic Unit Testing:**
    *   Introduced initial unit tests for the `QdrantClient` to verify its initialization and basic functionality (without requiring a running Qdrant instance). An integration test structure was also added (skipped by default) to facilitate testing against a live Qdrant instance later.

**Milestone Status:**

Milestone 2 is considered **partially complete**. The foundational data models and the architectural contracts (interfaces) are successfully defined and implemented. The basic setup for interacting with the Qdrant vector database is also in place.

**Next Steps (for full Milestone 2 completion & moving towards Milestone 5):**

*   Implement the remaining vector storage operations defined in the `VectorStore` interface within the `QdrantClient` adapter (e.g., `UpsertPoints`, `Search`, `DeletePoints`).
*   Develop concrete implementations for the Repository interfaces (e.g., using a relational database or document store).

This groundwork provides a solid structure for subsequent milestones involving file processing, AI integration, and API development.
