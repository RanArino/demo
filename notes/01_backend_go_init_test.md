# Testing the `backend-go` Service

This document outlines the steps taken to test the `backend-go` service independently after its Docker image was successfully built. The goal was to verify that the API routes and handlers, specifically the `/health` endpoint defined in `internal/api/router.go` and `internal/api/handlers.go`, were functioning correctly.

## Process

1.  **Isolating the Service:**
    *   To test `backend-go` without needing other services which might not be ready or configured, the `docker-compose.yml` file was temporarily modified.
    *   Within the `backend-go` service definition, the `depends_on` section and environment variables referencing other services (`ML_SERVICE_URL`, `QDRANT_HOST`, etc.) were commented out.
    *   This allowed us to start *only* the `backend-go` container using Docker Compose.

2.  **Preparing Volume Mount:**
    *   The `backend-go` service definition in `docker-compose.yml` includes a volume mount: `volumes: - ./data:/app/data`.
    *   To satisfy this requirement, the host directory was created:
        ```bash
        mkdir -p data
        ```

3.  **Running the Isolated Service:**
    *   With the service isolated and the volume directory created, the `backend-go` container was started using Docker Compose:
        ```bash
        # Ensure DOCKER_HOST is set if using Colima/non-standard socket
        # export DOCKER_HOST="unix://${HOME}/.colima/default/docker.sock" 
        
        docker compose up backend-go 
        ```
    *   The logs from the container were observed, confirming that the Gin web server started successfully and was listening on the configured port (e.g., 8080).

4.  **Verifying the `/health` Endpoint:**
    *   To check if the `/health` route was correctly configured in `router.go` and the corresponding handler in `handlers.go` was executing, an HTTP request was sent to the running container using `curl`:
        ```bash
        curl http://localhost:8080/health
        ```
    *   **Confirmation:** The command successfully returned the expected JSON response body:
        ```json
        {"status":"ok","timestamp":"YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.sssssssssZ","version":"0.1.0"} 
        ```
    *   **Conclusion:** This successful response confirms:
        *   The Gin router correctly mapped the `GET /health` request to the `HealthCheck` handler function.
        *   The `HealthCheck` handler function executed successfully, generated the JSON response, and sent it back.
        *   The service returned an HTTP 200 OK status code (as `curl` typically only shows the body on successful 2xx responses).

*(Optional: To explicitly view the HTTP status code and headers, the `curl -i` command can be used.)*

This testing process successfully validated the basic functionality of the API routing and the health check handler within the `backend-go` service running in its Docker container.
